        { 
            System.out.println ("ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException : "+ ex); 
        }  
    }
}

Output :exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException has already been caught
Explanation: This error has occured because the same ArrayOutOfBounds Exception was mentioned in the base class of the program during catch(e)
and then again it has been mentioned in subclass exception as catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBounds), thus the same error has been caught twice.
